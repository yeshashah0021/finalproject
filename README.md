The challenges that I faced throughout the final project was attempting the code. In the beginning it was hard and confusing to put the code in chronological order as well as making the actul code run. The graph was also hard to set up, making sure the axis was correctly labeled. Overall, it was a fun project, but was hard during sections of the project.
