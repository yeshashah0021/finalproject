# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Market Analyzer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will focus on downloading stock, visualizing trends, and calculating simple indicators. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project is a Stock Market Analyzer, analyzing past stock prices to see fluctuations over time. It extracts data directly from Yahoo Finance, and users input a stock code and the time range they want to analyze. This tool charts the prevailing price of the stock, 20-day and 50-day average prices, and day-to-day changes in price. The tool further gauges how much the price goes up and down to show the instrument's volatility, allowing its users to understand how risky the investment is. This tool will also provide very simple "buy" and "sell" signals based on these averages so the user can peruse when it may be a good time to trade. The customers run this utility from the command line, and it can be used with various stocks and time frames.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Anushka Tejeswi- Tus34228@temple.edu & TA: David Loder
Chandrahas Rachamadugu - tus23882@temple.edu & TA: Xinwen(Ellen) Zhang

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Stock Prices from any range
- How much the price goes up and down

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-Stock Prices from any range
-How much the price goes up and down
-Buy and Sell

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Stock Prices from any range
- How much the prices go up and down
- Buy and Sell option
- Graph of stock

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps for the Stock Market Analysis Tool are to learn some new skills, research key topics, and split tasks among the group. I know basic Python; therefore, Chandu will work on learning how to use the pandas library to handle data,
matplotlib for charting, and finance to obtain stock data. Now, we will each have a role: Chandu will set up the stock
data, I can work on creating charts, and Anushka will write code for calculating returns, volatility, and buy/sell signals. We'll have all of us review each other's work. We also need to do some general research on some common stock market terms, such as moving averages and volatility, so that we get what they mean within our tool. Third and lastly,
we will look at some examples of similar projects while designing and also for debugging.
